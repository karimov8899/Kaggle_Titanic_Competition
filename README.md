And, unfortunately, there were not enough boats for survival for everyone, and because of this, 1502 of 2224 passengers died. Based on data from this tragedy Kaggle created competition for building a ML model which would answer a lot of questions. Kaggle is a portal for Machine learning competitions. There are a lot of dataset for beginning our journey in machine learning and data analysis. The Titanic one is a beginner competition and the most popular one. We should build a ML model which would predict which passenger died or survived.</p>
